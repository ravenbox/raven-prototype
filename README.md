Raven is an open-source, highly-availabile communication platform designed for seamless text, voice and video interactions. Our primary goal is to provide users with a high-quality communication experience, making it ideal for gaming, online meetings, and social interactions.

## Features

- **High Availability**: Built to ensure continuous uptime and reliability.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for real-time communication with minimal delay.
- **High-Quality Communication**: Superior audio and video quality using WebRTC technology.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to support a growing number of users and channels.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate design for all users.

## Current Status

The current project is a prototype developed in **Golang**. While it's functional and demonstrates the core features of Raven, the main project will transition to **Rust** for improved performance and memory safety.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**:
  - **Current Prototype**: Golang
  - **Main Project**: Rust
- **WebRTC**: For real-time audio and video communication.
- **Databases**:
  - **Current Prototype**: In-memory
  - **Main Project**: Various relational databases; while the main Raven instance will use PostgreSQL, users have the freedom to choose a different database according to their needs, eg. SQLite, MySQL, etc.
